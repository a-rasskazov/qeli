/// Mirror of the Android `PushedFacts`. Only knowable after the handshake, so it travels on
/// `TunnelSnapshot` rather than being derived from the profile. Two deliberate limits:
///
/// * `routes` is CAPPED at ``routeSample`` entries with `routeCount` carrying the real total.
///   A server may advertise an arbitrarily long list — an operator pushing a country-sized
///   prefix set is a normal thing to do — and the detail sheet renders a row per entry.
///   Capping where the snapshot is built keeps both bounded instead of hoping the list stays
///   short.
/// * the session token is NOT here and must never be: it is the credential that authorises a
///   bonded stream to join this session.
///
/// It lives in its own file, apart from the rest of the protection model, because
/// `TunnelSnapshot` carries it and the WIDGET target compiles `TunnelSnapshot` from an
/// explicit file list. `ProtectionSummary` next door is built from a `VPNConfig`, so keeping
/// them together would drag the whole config model — and whatever it in turn reaches for —
/// into an extension that needs none of it.
